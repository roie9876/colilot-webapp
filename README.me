# Code Generation Chat App

This interactive Streamlit application integrates with Azure OpenAI to provide a coding-focused chatbot experience. You can ask questions, generate code snippets, and view colorized code blocks using a chat UI.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Create a .env file at the root of this project with your Azure OpenAI credentials (see below).  
3. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```
    streamlit run copilot-app.py
    ```

## .env File Example

Make a file named .env with the following details:

```
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://YOUR_ENDPOINT_NAME.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_O1=deployment_for_model_o1
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_O3=deployment_for_model_o3
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_GPT45=deployment_for_model_gpt-4.5
```

Replace each placeholder with your actual Azure OpenAI credentials and deployment names.

## Usage

When you open the browser window, you can:
1. Edit the system message in the “Edit System Message” expander to customize the assistant’s behavior.
2. Type your coding question or message in the chat input at the bottom.
3. Click “Clear Chat” if you want to reset the conversation.

You’ll see a wide layout chat window that streams responses from the Azure OpenAI model in real time.
