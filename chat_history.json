It demonstrates how to:\n\n1. Include the iostream header file (for input/output).\n2. Use the std::cout object to print text to the console.\n3. Define a main() function (the entry point of the program).\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>  // Include the iostream library for input and output\n\nint main() {\n    // Print \"Hello World\" to the console\n    std::cout << \"Hello World\" << std::endl;\n\n    return 0; // Return 0 indicates the program executed successfully\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The include directive `#include <iostream>` makes the `std::cout` object available, which is used to output data.\n- `int main()` defines the entry point for the program.\n- `std::endl` inserts a newline character and flushes the output buffer.\n- Returning 0 from `main()` signals that the program reached its end without any errors."}]
