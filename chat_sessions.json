It uses the standard iostream library to print text to your console:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream> // Include the iostream header for input/output operations\n\nint main() {\n    // std::cout is the standard output stream in C++\n    // << \"Hello World\" sends the string \"Hello World\" to the output stream\n    // std::endl adds a newline and flushes the output buffer\n    std::cout << \"Hello World\" << std::endl;\n\n    return 0; // Return 0 to indicate successful program completion\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. The #include <iostream> directive allows you to use input and output streams in C++.  \n2. The main function is the entry point to any C++ program, returning an integer to indicate its exit status (0 means success).  \n3. std::cout is the standard output stream. Using the << operator, we send the text to the console.  \n4. std::endl inserts a newline character and flushes the output buffer, ensuring the text is displayed immediately."}], "python hello world": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a highly knowledgeable and precise coding assistant.
