It uses the standard iostream library to print text to your console:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream> // Include the iostream header for input/output operations\n\nint main() {\n    // std::cout is the standard output stream in C++\n    // << \"Hello World\" sends the string \"Hello World\" to the output stream\n    // std::endl adds a newline and flushes the output buffer\n    std::cout << \"Hello World\" << std::endl;\n\n    return 0; // Return 0 to indicate successful program completion\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. The #include <iostream> directive allows you to use input and output streams in C++.  \n2. The main function is the entry point to any C++ program, returning an integer to indicate its exit status (0 means success).  \n3. std::cout is the standard output stream. Using the << operator, we send the text to the console.  \n4. std::endl inserts a newline character and flushes the output buffer, ensuring the text is displayed immediately."}], "python hello world": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a highly knowledgeable and precise coding assistant.

It gives a visual hierarchy that makes content more readable and easier to navigate.\n\n\u2022 Streamlit Features: Streamlit has different text display functions for titles, headers, subheaders, text, markdown, etc. Each of these provides helpful styling and spacing without requiring you to manually manage HTML or CSS. By using dedicated functions like st.header, your code becomes more concise and readable.\n\nIn short, st.header is a simple but effective way to format a clear, bold header within your Streamlit user interface, signaling that you\u2019re introducing a new section or topic."}]}
